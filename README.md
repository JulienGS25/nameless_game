# nameless_game

As of yet unnamed web-based incremental game based on the evolution of a civilization, from cavemen to a sparefaring species.
Inspired by Kittens Game, CivClicker and others.

I'm learning as I go, so if anyone is looking at my code, please be gentle :)

Other than the regular web languages, this only uses JQuery for now but I'm trying to use vanilla JS as much as possible.
